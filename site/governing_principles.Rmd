At the outset of the collaboration, we established __seven key governing principles__ for our collaborative endevour.

<br>

<div class="well">
<font size="4">

* Collaborate in an environment of honesty, fairness and trust.
* Promote early-career researchers.
* Respect other groups’ data.
* Operate transparently with a goal of no surprises.
* Seek permission from each group to use results prior to public release.
* Do not share another group’s results with other parties without permission.
* We should not inhibit any work being done within an individual group (or between pairs of groups, etc).
